## ðŸ’¼ Business Strategy Guide

1. **PPC (Google/Facebook)**: Highest quality leads, ~$100-200 CPL
2. **Cold Calling**: High volume, ~$50-100 CPL
3. **SMS Campaigns**: Good for follow-ups, ~$75-150 CPL
4. **Direct Mail**: Lower response rate but quality leads

### Deal Structure Guidelines

#### Wholesale Deals
- Target: 70% ARV - Repairs - $15,000 (your fee)
- Average profit: $10,000-$25,000 per deal
- Close time: 7-30 days

#### Subject-To Deals
- Target: Properties with existing low-interest mortgages
- Average profit: $15,000-$35,000 per deal
- Best for: Properties with little to no equity

### Monthly Goals to Hit $35,000
- **Option 1**: 3 wholesale deals @ $12,000 each
- **Option 2**: 2 subject-to deals @ $17,500 each
- **Option 3**: 2 wholesale @ $10,000 + 1 subject-to @ $15,000

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Leads per month: 50-100
- Lead to contract ratio: 3-5%
- Average days to close: 14-21
- Marketing spend: $2,000-$5,000/month
- ROI: 7-10x marketing spend

## ðŸ”§ Customization

### Adding Custom Fields
Edit `src/App.jsx` to add new fields to the lead object:
```javascript
const [newLead, setNewLead] = useState({
  // Add your custom fields here
  customField: '',
  // ...
});
```

### Modifying MAO Formula
Update the `calculateMAO` function in `App.jsx`:
```javascript
const calculateMAO = (arv, repairCost) => {
  const wholesaleFee = 15000; // Adjust your fee
  const percentage = 0.7; // Adjust percentage
  return (arv * percentage) - repairCost - wholesaleFee;
};
```

## ðŸ“Š Database Integration (Optional)

For production use, integrate with a backend:

### Recommended Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express or Python FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Auth0 or Firebase Auth
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or Cloudinary

### API Endpoints Needed
- `GET /api/leads` - Fetch all leads
- `POST /api/leads` - Create new lead
- `PUT /api/leads/:id` - Update lead
- `DELETE /api/leads/:id` - Delete lead
- `GET /api/campaigns` - Marketing campaigns
- `GET /api/buyers` - Buyers list
- `POST /api/contracts` - Generate contracts

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations
- Implement user authentication
- Use HTTPS in production
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Regular backups
- GDPR compliance for lead data

## ðŸ“§ Support
For questions or customization needs, refer to the code documentation or consult with a developer.

## ðŸ“„ License
